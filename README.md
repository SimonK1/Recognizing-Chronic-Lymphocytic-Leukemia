# Recognizing Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia

This project was developed as a school assignment for course Intelligent Data Analysis (FIIT STU). The point of this project was to create and train a machine learning model for chronic lymphocytic leukemia recognition. Project consists of three phases - 1. Exploratory Data Analysis, 2. Data Preprocessing, 3. Machine Learning Model. Machine learning model was trained to recognize patients with Chronic Leukemia according to the number of leukocytes in their blood (Factor with highest correlation). This project is written entirely in Python and was developed without using any external sources. Code comments are written in Slovak and are currently being translated to English. 

-  Programming Language: Python
- Code Language: English
- Comments Language: Slovak (English Soon)
- User Interface Language: None
